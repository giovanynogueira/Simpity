# Simpity
Official GitHub repository for Simpity platform.

To deploy just access the file index.html.

No credentials are required, it is a version that allows to visualize the Simpity platform, but it still is a demo code.

To navigate between pages, just click at each button, and a linked page will load.

The file "solana.js" has the code that we pretend to use in the future to develop the functions of Simpity. Some procedures of security are necessary to make it possible.

Integrations with Wormhole and Circle will help with security and practicality.
