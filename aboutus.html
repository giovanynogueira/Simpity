        We are Simpity, a dedicated company to prevent dubious-origin products from being sold and purchased around the world. Our story starts in Brazil with our founder Giovany Nogueira, conscious of piracy and preparing to participate in a hackathon known as Sigma Sprint 2024. He had the opportunity in his hands; everything seemed to fit, and he did it. His mind led us to this effective, simple, and practical tool, and he has also connected all of it to the world of the chains, which has too much to incorporate in Simpity to make it even better and secure.
        <br><br>
        With simplicity, we want to make you happy, and with all the security as possible.
        <br><br>
        Simplicity, happiness, and security.
        <br><br>
        This is Simpity.
